Created On: 10-Feb-18

Status - 2 Projects so far
First Project - Binary Classification:
  Type: Neural Network
  Layers: 2
  Activation Function Used: Sigmoid
  Error correction method: Back Propagation
  Training the parameters to predict the output from a training set
  
 Second Project - House Price Prediction
  Type: Linear Regression
  Algorithm: Gradient Descent
  Error Correction method: Mean Squared Error
  Predicts the selling price of house based on 3 input features(No of Bedrooms, No of Bathrooms, No of Floors)

This repository contains my early works and experiments in Deep Learning with python. All the files create a similar style of ANN, tailored for different sets of data to get optimal and accurate prediction.
